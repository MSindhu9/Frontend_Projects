    <h2>
        SHIRIDI SAI BABA
    </h2>
    <p>
       <b>Sai Baba of Shirdi</b>  (c. 1838? 15 October 1918),also known as Shirdi Sai Baba, was an Indian yogi, spiritual master and fakir, considered to be a saint, revered by both Hindu and Muslim devotees during and after his lifetime.

According to accounts from his life, Sai Baba preached the importance of "realization of the self" and criticized "love towards perishable things". His teachings concentrate on a moral code of love, forgiveness, helping others, charity, contentment, inner peace, and devotion to God and Guru. He stressed the importance of surrender to the true Satguru, who, having trodden the path to divine consciousness, can lead the disciple through the jungle of spiritual growth.
